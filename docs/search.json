    "text": "[Edit on GDocs]\n\nPrepare the text in English. The Chicago Manual of Style 17th Edition (CMOS) is being used as the overall publication style. We will stay close to (CMOS) but not 100% compliant as we have many non/English native writers and styles vary. Points to note will be:\n\nWe will use International English as the primary audience is English as a second language in Europe as the expectation of the reader leans towards UK English. For example end wods is ise and ize, but use US License as Creative Commons use the US form of license. This also applies to en and em dashes, use spaces unlike the US with no space. Refer to The Economist style guide as that caters to a US EN audience.\n\nUse the Oxford Comma. Which means the presence of a comma before and or or in a list of three or more items.\n\nEn and em dash policy. For em dash use we’ll keep with CMOS guidelines on em dash used for punctuation em dash with space before and after (USA and CMOS have no space but in Europe it is more common to have space either side. Make sure en dashes are used where needed and not hyphens.\n\n\nTypesetting punctuation:\n\nUse no breaking hyphens in phrases like Co‑creation – Word instructions https://word.tips.net/T001116_Inserting_a_Non-Breaking_Hyphen.html – HTML https://www.toptal.com/designers/htmlarrows/punctuation/non-breaking-hyphen/\n\n\nCapitalisation:\n\nFor terms like open science, open access, open data, or FAIR data, etc. Generally we will aim for lowercase words to keep the reading flow easy, follow this rule for movements, schools. https://7sage.com/admissions/lesson/capitalization/ Capitalize the names of movements and schools derived from proper nouns; lowercase those that are not. Unfortunately, there are some exceptions: “Cynic,” “Scholasticism” and “New Criticism,” for example, are capitalized when used as movements. Look a term up in Merriam-Webster if you’re not sure. romanticism; Keynesian economics; cubism; Cynicism. The rule of thumb can also be applied that capitalisation is to get rid of ambiguity. So in our example\n\nFAIR data would have acronym capitalised\n\nOpen science, open data, and open access – would all be lowercase\n\nOpen source software – here we run into the ‘rival camps’ problem. There is the Free Software Foundation (Richard Stallman) and the Open Source (Eric Raymond) movement who disagree on ideologies. Properly the full term should be use Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) but its a mouthful. And there is more to the story. Our get out is to use the precompound adjective open-source.\n\nI will list more examples as they come up.\n\nArticle titles capitalised as ‘title capitalisation’, running headers only first word and after :\n\nJob or role title removed.\n\n\n\n2.0.1 Article Template Guides\n\n2.0.1.1 Section introduction - to be written by section editor\n\nThe text is a maximum of 400 words, 2800 characters including spaces (including Tables, Figures, Photos)\nTitle and headline.\n\nOne image\n\nAdd three or more learning outputs in an info box style.

Articles need a featured image if possible, note it’s optional to have a featured image. This should be placed immediately after the article title or after the intro and author credit. It depends on how the article looks in layout as to its placement. Place other images in the article to help communicate the work. If the contributor or youself cannot source any images then please raise a ticket and the editorial group will take on board the task.\n\nUse of academic titles for authors and editors:? Generally remove. But if unsure consult the editorial group for support cs4rl/guide#35\n\nUse them if provided by author in attribution? TBC\n\nBook information: Copyright pages, authors, etc., do not use\n\n\nThe text should have a Title (between 1 and 10 words).\n\nThe text should have a headline summary that briefly outlines the content of the section (max. 30 words).\n\nFor each introduction author submit a name, department and institution, and ORCID iD. But not job title. See example https://write.handbuch.io/document/465\n\nArticle DOI line. Add as Article DOI: 10.25815/f360-s580 | You can retrieve DOIs from the article page plan Google spreadsheet. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cPhzMjs3otETY_jHPOa43TWs4IaGgIllmHa1SpcGsVY/edit#gid=0\n\nArticle Info Boxes and Case Studies formatting: Currently this is a bit of a work around as applying an inline style is not possible in other ways. To make an info box first create a table with only one cell, then paste content into the cell and format as usual. The effect of using the table is that it puts a blue background behind and around the text.\n\nPlease divide the text into sections, with the following. Note: There is a Header hierarchy view on the left of Documents accessible via the ‘scroll’ icon.:\n\nHeadings H2,\n\nSubheadings H3.\n\n\nDo not include a Table of Contents.\n\nUse single space for spacing.\n\nDo not use line spaces between paragraphs or for line spacing, instead use space before and after paragraph or header.\n\nUse single column format.\n\nTables and figures. To be placed in individual files. Tables should serve a purpose and display cores data in a brief and structured way.\n\nEach Table and Figure are automatically numbered by the publishing pipeline, there is no need to manually add them. A brief description placed below that correspond with the file. All Figures in min. 600 dpi resolution or vector graphic.\n\nA maximum of three core references listed at the very bottom.\n\nUse The Chicago Manual of Style 187th Edition style for references. All references should have an author or organization given first. Also please list a DOI for each reference if possible.\nSample reference:\nAyris, Paul, Isabel Bernal, Valentino Cavalli, Bertil Dorch, Jeannette Frey, Martin Hallik, Kristiina Hormia-Poutanen, et al. ‘LIBER Open Science Roadmap’.

ORCID ORCID iD: followed by 16 digit number and not URL as commonly used. No full stop or comma after ORCID iD or e-mail as to not interfere with both. Link to both and make links active.\n\nSee example: By Jitka Stilund Hansen, DTU Library, Technical University of Denmark, (ORCID iD: 0000-0002-5888-1221).\n\nRefer to sections numbers as Section #1 or Section #2.",

See the Book area of the site to preview content in final outputs such as PDF, eBook, Web, WebBook, etc.\n\nImages: Images can be configured to appear in text as: figures, photos, to replace tables, etc. Also figures can be set to display captions or not. Last images can be set as 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% width. Image widths can be set later at the time of publishing.\n\nIntro, author, and DOI styling. See example: https://write.handbuch.io/document/465. Intro uses the Abstract style. Author text as Normal style. DOI line is made as bold.\n\nAdding or converting manual added citations. Fidus Writer has a citation manager that needs to be used as this applies citation style langauge to citations - styling them and organising them. Place cursor inline where you want the citation to be inserted. In top menu select Cite - you will be able to either search databases for citation or manually add a citation. The citation will be added inline and at bottom of article. Citations get automatically styled if citation style is changed. Citations can be edited by clicking them in the bottom of the article.\n\nInserting footnotes. Use * tool from format toolbar at top of document.\n\nTables. Tables can be added and edited from the format toolbar and via the three dot edit icon inline. Note: Currently in the CS Guide publications tables are exclusively used to style the info boxes. See information in the Article finishing section.\n\nSpelling and grammar check: A spellchecker is available from the Tools menu. Once spelling and grammar checker has been loaded - right click on marked items to see correction suggestions. To remove marks use the menu item: Tools &gt; Spelling and Grammar &gt; Remove items.\n\nLinks: URL links can be added and edited. Do not use the internal links function as this does not work for all outputs.\n\nSave revisions: You can make snapshot saved revisions - for example to save a copy prior to editing reviews. These revisions need to be loaded back into the system as new documents which is a bit cumbersome. Contact support to revert to a revision.\n\nSharing articles: to give others access to documents you need to share the document with a specific user. See the file menu for sharing options.\n\nTrack changes: There is full track changes functionality if needed. See the top level menu item in documents.",
